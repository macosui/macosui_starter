A starter Flutter app for macOS with `macos_ui`.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application specifically targeting macOS and uses the `macos_ui` plugin
to achieve UI and UX that match native AppKit and SwiftUI as closely as possible.

- [Generating Starter Apps](https://macosui.dev/docs/starter_apps)
- [API Reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/macos_ui/latest/)

For help getting started with Flutter development in general, view the

samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
